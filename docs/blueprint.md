## Core Features:

- Text Selection Detection: Detect selected text layers in Figma and display a warning if none are selected.
- Legacy Text Input: Provide a textarea for pasting legacy Malayalam text.
- Unicode Conversion Tool: Convert legacy Malayalam to Unicode Malayalam text using character mapping. This tool will attempt to handle common conjuncts and chillu characters. This conversion service is entirely client-side within the plugin for enhanced security.
- Unicode Preview: Display a live preview of the converted Unicode Malayalam text.
- Apply Unicode to Figma: Replace selected Figma text layer content with converted Unicode text, preserving styles.
- Font Selection & Application: Offer a dropdown to select from Unicode Malayalam fonts and apply to selected text (Noto Sans Malayalam, Noto Serif Malayalam, Chilanka, Uroob).
- Typography Controls: Provide inputs for font size, line height (default 1.5), and letter spacing, and apply to selected text layers.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft beige (#F5F5DC) to evoke a sense of tradition and literacy.
- Background color: Off-white (#FAFAF0), a slightly brighter variant of the primary color at low saturation, creating a gentle contrast.
- Accent color: Muted brown (#A68B64) for buttons and key UI elements, drawing subtle attention without overwhelming.
- Headline font: 'Literata' serif for headlines and titles to give a literary, readable feel.
- Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif for the main text and descriptions for maximum readability.
- Use simple, line-based icons that represent text conversion and Malayalam script. These icons should be subtle and not distract from the text.
- Employ a clean and well-spaced layout to accommodate Malayalam text and ensure readability. All input elements are well aligned.
